# problem:
# We define a magic square to be an n x n matrix of distinct positive integers
# from 1 to nÂ² where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always
# equal to the same number: the magic constant.
# You will be given a 3 x 3 matrix s of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9].
# We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1, 9] at cost of [a-b] .
# Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
# Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range
# solution:

# defining the function which will create a magic square
